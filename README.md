You are given three integers start, finish, and limit. You are also given a 0-indexed string s representing a positive integer.
A positive integer x is called powerful if it ends with s (in other words, s is a suffix of x) and each digit in x is at most limit.
Return the total number of powerful integers in the range [start..finish].
A string x is a suffix of a string y if and only if x is a substring of y that starts from some index (including 0) in y and extends to the index y.length - 1. For example, 25 is a suffix of 5125 whereas 512 is not.
